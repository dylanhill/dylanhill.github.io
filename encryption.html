			<h1>Encryption</h1>
			<p>When it comes to protecting your digital files and communications one of the most effective strategies is encryption. In fact, most of the protection strategies that are examined in this lesson will be dependent on some form encryption. </p>

			<p>However, the encryption that is applied can vary depending on the data type or where it is being used, and not all encryption is created equal. For this reason, it is worth discussing in a little detail how encryption works, and how it varies.

		<h3>Longevity for local storage</h3>

		<p>It is important to understand the issues related to data longevity issues and local storage (e.g., files and media stored on your phones and computer). First simply deleting a file on your phone, sending a file to the trash and emptying your trash on your computer, is not enough to securely remove the data. The files that you remove can still be forensically recovered, unless you take additional actions, such as use special software that will erase data.</p>

		<p>In addition, most device and computers now have solid state hard drives (SSDs). The data on these drives often cannot ever be fully erased. Due to this type of hard drive design, bits can be recovered in certain circumstances.</p>

		<h3>Longevity for Data on Servers</h3>

		<p>Data storage on cloud servers is now extremely economical. In addition, aggregated data is extremely valuable to many entities, such as advertisers, employers, schools, and governments. Maintaining vast records on cloud platforms for indefinite time periods is now the norm, and storing data for perpetuity (or at least your lifetime), is a feasible reality. This means even something stored or communicated 10 years ago might prove to be an issue if authorities gain access to data. </p>

			<h3>Data Location</h3>
			<p>This data longevity opens up additional considerations when conducting sensitive work inside China. It is important to avoid Chinese-owned social media platforms and cloud storage, whenever you can, for communications that could be considered sensitive work. Under the Cybersecurity law introduced in 2017, all data collected inside China must be stored in China, and Chinese internet companies are required to use China-located storage. This means access to your stored files and data is especially easy inside China, if there is an interest in your work.</p>

			<p>For this reason, people working on sensitive issues choose to store their files on servers outside China, and with service providers that are not currently working inside China. This is a necessary step to protect the information.</p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> is also means that simply the act of conducting data collection inside China could be categorized as illegal behavior. However, there have not been known arrests for this behavior yet.</p>

			<h3>Market Intentions</h3>
			<p>To make things more challenging, simply placing your data on non-Chinese platforms is not an easy solution. It requires regular due diligence and assessment of the service providers. Many companies are very eager to join Chinese markets. Under the Cybersecruity laws and regulation, to enter China, these companies must also ensure any data and files collected in China to Chinese located servers. And their eagerness to join markets often leads to over compliance with Chinese authority requests. Apple’s recent willingness to move iCloud data to Chinese servers demonstrates the necessity of regularly evaluating the service providers you are using to host your data.</p>

			<p>In addition, cloud services providers can read all of the content of your files and media, meaning they can readily share your information if they choose to do so. Achieving security when using these services will depend on the service provider you choose, and the protection strategies you choose to employ.</p>

			<h3>Vulnerability of the Cloud</h3>
			<p>It is a fairly accepted truth in the information security field, that all attacks on servers cannot be prevented. If something is connected to the internet it is vulnerable. In addition, given that Chinese authorities have excellent resources and tools, their success rate can be high.</p>

			<p>The general approach that cloud services take is to mitigate risks by layering protection against their network connections and how data is stored and access. Therefore, it is worth understanding the types of encryption and other protection measures that are used by a service provider, and considering their data privacy policies.</p>

			<h3>Device Seizure</h3>
			<p>Finally, the stored data on devices makes device seizure a particular concern for people working on sensitive issues. Persons being “asked to tea” or arrested are regularly asked or required to provide their devices to authorities. They are also regularly required to provide the passwords. This is a common threat and requires good digital hygiene and regular cleaning of stored data to mitigate the risks.</p>
