			<h1>Data Harvesting</h1>
			<p>Given the value of data in our global business market, it is almost impossible to use the internet without some form of data harvesting occurring. As noted in earlier topics, various data points can be used to develop a very robust picture of your activities, your communications and your contacts. Given the amount of data that is possible on a mobile device, app data harvesting on mobile devices is particularly problematic.</p>

		<h3>App Data Harvesting</h3>
		<p>Apps are now generally designed to gather as much data as possible, even in unexpected and unnecessary situations. For example, consider that a Word document created using Office 365 will automatically upload your location data, at the time of creating the file, to Microsoft servers if you have not actively taken steps to turned off this capability. These apps also have access to data in completely expected ways. For example, an app like WeChat has access to your mic, camera, stored images, and to your contacts. While the app uses these features in ways you would legitimately wish for, such as posting an image you just took to your account, or having a video chat with a friend, this does not eliminate the possibility of surveillance with the same features. </p>

		<p>Android and iPhone devices have introduced features that are designed to enable phone operators to control the permissions that are granted to apps. These are useful features and should be applied, and iPhone’s features have proven a little more reliable than the Android OS. However, this feature in both operating systems do not offer any guaranteed protection.</p>

		<h3>Web Browser Data Harvesting</h3>
		
		<p>In addition to data collected by apps, web browsers gather and store vast amounts of data. Websites can set cookies, that can to include tracking features, and other types of data to be used by services such as Google Analytics (which is one Google service known to not be blocked inside China). Many of these cookies are sending your entire browsing history to various servers, often in completed unencrypted formats.</p>

		<p>For example, the Chrome browser readily shares:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>your browsing history</li>
			<li>your geolocation data (if you have allowed)</li>
			<li>The browser app and version you are using</li>
			<li>And the OS you are using (or at least the OS the browser is compiled for, which is most likely to be the OS you are using)</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>Geolocation data harvesting</h3>
			<p>It is worth looking in detail the level of geolocation data that is possible. Consider this timeline created using Google Maps Timeline:</p>

			<h3>Unexpected Geolocation data</h3>
			<p>Geolocation data, and other important data can be obtained from unexpected places. </p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Phones turned off</em><br>
				Mobile devices can be geolocators even when turned off, or when not connected to the network. Many apps are designed to continue to collect data when offline, and simply send the data to servers as soon as the phone is back online. Mobile devices even when turned off can potentially be pinged by cell towers (which as noted in previously provides another form of geolocation data).</li>
				<li><em>Chips in cards and IDs are now a source of geodata</em><br>
				If you walk past a scanner able to read the chip it will be able to identify you at that point in time, at that location.</li>
				<li><em>Images</em><br>
				Digital cameras and phone now embed geolocation information, as well as many other identifying pieces of data into photos. Even if the social media platform has chosen not to display the location data, it is still possible the data is embedded in the image file itself.</li>
				<li><em>Social Media posts</em><br>
				Some social media platforms automatically identify location of posts. And even if this is not actively identified talking about travels, or pictures of activities can provide significant clues about your locations, your activities, your habits, and whom you are interacting with.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Your Contacts</h3>

			<p>Your contacts, such as social media networks and your phone’s contact lists are a significant risk from data harvesting. For example, Facebook harvests contact information from Whatsapp users by default. And various apps request access to your phone’s contacts list even when they often have no readily apparent reason to use the data. In addition, contacts stored in cloud services have the potential to be accessed by authorities.</p>

			<p>When doing sensitive work, it is important to consider the risk of exposing your identity, but also the risk of exposing the identity of other vulnerable people, or the identity of persons you might be working with that make your vulnerable. </p>

			<h3>All Devices Need to Be Considered</h3>

			<p>Finally, it is important to remember, the following types of devices are collecting data as well as your phones:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cameras</li>
				<li>Watches</li>
				<li>E-Book readers</li>
				<li>Activity tracker (e.g., Fitbit, Wear)</li>
				<li>Smart TVs</li>
				<li>Internet of Things devices such as Alexis</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Topic Review</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Data is harvested constantly occurring, even from unexpected sources, including office software and web cookies</li>
			<li>Geolocation data is especially divulging of your location and activities..</li>
			<li>Being offline is not enough to ensure your data is not collected. Often applications store data and send it to servers as soon as a device connects to the internet again..</li>
			<li>Turning off your device is at times not enough to stop the data collection. .</li>
			<li>Your network’s contacts are an especially sensitive piece of data, and it is important to consider how it is stored.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In our hyper connected digital space, the approach you might use to avoid data harvesting can vary depending on the device or the type of data that is in consideration. There are some strategies to mitigate the issues that will be considering in our Protection Strategies section.</p>
