			<h1>Mobile Watchers</h1>
			<p>Mobile devices are especially challenging for digital security. We tend to always have at least one phone on us and often carry multiple devices. It is important to understand how and when phones are collecting data and tracking your location (almost everything, almost always), and where and how they are storing your communications and media files to be able to select protection strategies. In essence we carry with us a digital watcher at all times.</p>

		<h3>How Cell Phones Operate</h3>
		<p>To understand what and how data is being collected it is useful to first understand how a cell phone operates and where the various data points exist.</p>

		<h3>Multiple Data Points to be Aware Of</h3>
		
		<p>Based on how the cell phone networks operate, there are multiple points of data that you have to be concerned about as they can be used to identify you and your activities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IEMI/ MEID</li>
			<li>SIM card</li>
			<li>Phone number</li>
			<li>Pinging cell tower</li>
		</ul>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row darkkdiv">
		
		<div class="col-sm-12 main-header">
			<h3>MEID and IMEI numbers</h3>
			<p>Phones carry a serial number, and a MEID (mobile equipment ID) or IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity. The MEID/IMEI is used to locate a device on a network, and it is registered with a cell service provider when using a provider's SIM. </p>

			<p>This means there is a highly unique hardware identifier that cannot be disassociated from the phone. Since phones have this MEID/IMEI number, even if you change a SIM, if you place that SIM in a phone that you have used with a previous phone number it still has the potential to still be identified as yours.</p>


		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12 main-header">
			<h3>SIMs</h3>
			<p>Most mobile users are familiar with SIMs. This is the card you place in your phone to associate your phone with the cell subscribers, and it grants you access to the network. In addition, the SIM associates your network service account with a phone number, enabling the phone number to be used to find your phone (instead of the MEID or IMEI).</p>

			<p>With China’s Real Name requirements, SIMS trace back to a service subscriber’s account which directly traces back to a real person. Since the phone number is associated with the SIM and subscribers account, the same is true for phone numbers.</p>

			<p>Another issue to be aware of is, using a non-Chinese SIM inside China is not an effective way to mask your identity, depending on the way you have established the account. For example, if you have a U.S. purchased SIM, and it is able to provide service inside China, this service is possible because the phone connection has rolled over to a Chinese service provider. A digital “handshake” is performed between the U.S. network provider and the Chinese cell network provider. At the time of this handshake various pieces of data are shared between the providers, including your phone number, and potentially any name registered with that service. All communications inside China are known (steps to mitigate this fact are discussed in the Strategies section).</p>

			<h3>Pinging Cell Towers</h3>

			<p>In addition to MEID, IMEI, SIM cards and phone numbers, the cell towers themselves are also data points. As a cell tower sends out a connection to your phone, using another cell tower connection points nearby, it is possible to triangulate your location.</p>

			<p>It is also worth highlighting the relationship of the cell tower to the phone. Even when the phone is turned off, the cell network is still seeking the phone. This means simply turning your phone off is often not enough to ensure that your geo location is not identifiable, depending on the phone’s hardware. </p>

		<h3>Topic Review</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A cell phone can be especially insecure because there are so many data sources that can be used to surveil your activities and communications </li>
			<li>SIMs and phone numbers are registered back to your real identity inside China.</li>
			<li>A cell phone has a physical “serial number” that can identify you, even if you switch SIMs, if you have already used that phone with a prior service that knows your identity.</li>
			<li>Cell phone service providers have a “handshake” that shares your account information when you switch from one service provider to another.</li>
			<li>All cell services switch to Chinese networks inside China.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once you understand how much data is captured and when, it is clear masking your communications on a mobile device is a real challenge. However, it is possible. In our Protection Strategies section, we will look at how to setup a “burner” phone, that you can use to overcome the hurdles that exist with mobile devices. </p>
