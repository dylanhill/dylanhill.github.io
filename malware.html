			<h1>Malware and and Social Engineering</h1>
			<p>Malware (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojans, spybots) can be used to corrupt files, capture sensitive data, and various other activities that compromise the security of your communications, and data. For example, there are known cases of malware being used to turn on webcams and microphones turning a device into an extremely effective surveillance tool. Another example includes keyloggers that are used to capture sensitive data you create on computers, and your passwords.</p>

			<p>For this reason, it is important to be sure that your computers and devices do not have malware installed. It is also important to consider all of the apps you choose for install.</p>

		<h3>Accidently Installing Malware</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately, it is extremely easy to accidently install malware. Some ways to consider are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Opening email attachments</li>
			<li>Downloading pirated software and media</li>
			<li>Downloading and installing apps from the internet that have malware injected</li>
			<li>Clicking accept links from questionable sites you are visiting</li>
			<li>Inserting media devices such as USBs that already contain malware</li>
			<li>entering personal information into a site that is made to look like another site</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Social Engineering</h3>

		<p>Social engineering is when someone targets you in a personal way. For example, an attacker might send a message that appears to be from a well-established bank that you use, asking you to login, or they might ask for help with a charity that many people care about. Social engineering is an especially effective way to trick people into installing malware. It is also an especially effective way to trick people into divulging sensitive information such as username and passwords, even if the attack doesnâ€™t lead to the install of malware.</p>
		<p>If you are a person of interest to authorities, the social engineering you encounter can become especially sophisticated. It can be personalized emails or messages that use your name while talking about an upcoming event you are familiar with and likely to attend (e.g., a professional conference you attended the year before). It could be messages with activities occurring in your hometown using identities of people you know. It can be emails made to look like they were sent from someone you know (email spoofing is a common attack). With social media platforms providing a rich source of personal information, it is now quite easy to highly personalize an attack.</p>

			<h3>Removing Malware</h3>
			<p>It is extremely difficult to remove a malware application once it is installed, without significant technical expertise and time commitment. Most malware is purposely designed to be hard to detect, and malware applications will often hide files designed to re-install themselves should the original malware be detected and removed.

			<p>For this reason, if you suspect that there is malware installed on your machine, the only reliable strategy for you to remove malware is a clean install. The steps for achieving a clean install will be covered in the Protections Strategies lesson of this course.</p>

			<li>Opening unknown emails, attachments, and links can lead to malware installs</li>
			<li>Pirated or other unverified software installs that often include malware.</li>
			<li>It is important to consider the threat of social engineering attempts. They are an effective way to trick you into installing malware.</li>
			<li>Once installed, malware is very hard to remove. A clean install is necessary.</li>
