			<h1>Network Analysis</h1>
			<p>The contents of your communications and files, as they travel across communication networks, are not your only concern. It is also important to consider the data that is associated with your communication interactions, often referred to as metadata. This includes data points such as:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>phone numbers</li>
				<li>dates and times of interactions</li>
				<li>usernames</li>
				<li>connection points for networks</li>
				<li>types of devices used</li>
				<li>emails</li>
				<li>IP addresses</li>
				<li>social network connections</li>
				<li>and more</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Data Points Form a Picture</h3>

		<img src="images/pixels-2-pic.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Picture of a person's head appear inside a collection of pixels">
		<p>The pieces of information, supplied by metadata, can be used to pinpoint your identity, the identities of those you are communicating with, the timing of your communications, and other relevant information, even if you have encrypted your communications. Small points of information can be used to form a rather robust understanding of your activities. Depending upon your circumstances and type of work, simply who and when you are talking with another individual can be as much of a security issue as what you are talking about.</p>

		<p>This includes phone number to phone number connections made for SMS messages, cell phone calls and landline calls.</p>

		<h3>IP to IP Connections</h3>
		
		<p>To better understand the threats associated with internet communications, it can be useful to understand in a little detail how connections are made. The Internet, as you currently experience it, is primarily based on a standardized set of rules and procedures called the TCP/IP Protocol. This protocol is designed to connect one Internet Protocol Address (IP) to another IP, “hopping” across a network of servers until the connection is made. This IP to IP connection is the basis for all communications across the Internet, and cannot be avoided.</p>

		<p>To connect to the internet, your computer or device is assigned an IP, that allows it to be identified on the network. This is a concept many of you are already familiar with. What is worth highlighting is, since your computer or device is assigned this IP, by your internet provider or your cell service provider, the IP can be easily used to identify you. And since an internet connection must also include the IP you are connecting to, the type of activities you are conducting and the web pages you are you are reading can be deduced.</p>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> a domain name (e.g., wechat.com) is simply an easy to remember name (referred to as a domain name) that is linked to an IP. In the end, all internet connections resolve to an IP to IP connection in some form.</p>

			<h3>Challenges with Real Name Requirements</h3>

			<div class="col"><img src="images/ID2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Back for a sample Chinese ID"></div>
		</div>

			<p>The Real Name requirements inside China make it especially difficult to use communication networks without easily tracing your identity. There are Real Name requirements, that enforce registration back to a verified person, for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>land line services</li>
				<li>home internet services</li>
				<li>cell phone services</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Masking your identity when all of the primary communication networks require Real Name verification is especially challenging.</p>

			<h3>Communication Logs are Stored</h3>
			<img src="images/logs.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="image of computer log data on a computer screen">
			<p>In addition, the communications are not ephemeral. There are logs of the connections and the communications made. The Cybersecurity law introduced in 2017, and its related rules and regulations, have only increased the access and surveillance by authorities of these communication companies’ networks. These companies are now required to:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>maintain various data logs for a set time period</li>
				<li>to perform real name verification of users of services</li>
				<li>to share records that demonstrate compliance with the Real Name verification of individuals using their network services</li>
				<li>store all logs inside China</li>
				<li>to have network monitoring mechanisms in place</li>
				<li>report suspicious behaviors</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><i>All</i> Communications in China Travel Across Chinese Networks</h3>

			<p>It is also important to remember, that even if you are using non-Chinese services, the traffic must still travel across Chinese owned networks if you are inside China. As noted, with network analysis, it is important to be aware that even if the contents are protected, whom and when you are connecting with a person or service can still be viewed. This becomes especially relevant, when all communications inside China run across Chinese networks, since this means it is possible for all metadata of your communications to be accessible to Chinese authorities (without appropriate protections).</p>
			
			<p>For example, using Google Drive will ensure that your contents reside on Google’s services outside China, however, the fact that you have connected to Google Drive can be known. </p>

			<p>Just as with Network Snooping, the following entities can view your traffic’s metadata:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>the companies that run the networks</li>
				<li>governments or other authorities that request access to the data that runs across the networks</li>
				<li>anyone that is also on the same network (e.g., shared internet café wifi or company internet)</li>
				<li>or by someone that hacked into an existing network</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>VPNs are often Monitored</h3>

			<div class="col"><img src="images/expressvpn.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Express VPN logo"></div>
		</div>
<p>Finally, you might already be familiar with some of the protection benefits of VPNs. However, the type of VPN used, and the service providing the VPN need to be considered. For many business, commercial and public VPNs, the traffic is fully monitored by Chinese authorities. VPNs will be looked at in more detail in the Strategies section.</p>

		<h3>Topic Review</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Network analysis is a particularly challenging threat to select and apply protection strategies that work. </li>
			<li>Land phone calls, mobile calls or SMS messages are especially vulnerable to network analysis (and the related threat of snooping). </li>
			<li>The open nature of Internet protocols also makes your internet communications open to snooping.</li>
			<li>VPNs do not necessarily make you more secure.</li>
			<li>Strong encryption is needed to secure your network traffic.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>There is no single strategy to protect against network analysis. The exact strategy you apply will be dependent on the network you are using, your physical location, and the device you are using. Appropriate strategies will be explored in the Strategies section.</p>
