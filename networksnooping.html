			<h1>Network Snooping</h1>
			<P>In general, all communication networks are open and vulnerable to "snooping". Network snooping is the act of eavesdrops on digital traffic. Given the intentional open design of most  communication networks (e.g., SMS, Land Line phones, Internet), snooping is not difficult, especially if you have government resources. For this reason, if you aren’t sure, you should consider any networks you are using to be unsafe.</P>

			<h3>Networks' Open Design</h3>
			<img src="images/phone-operators.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<p>Networks, in the context of this course, are understood as the services, wires and hardware used to transport data from one device or computer system to another when they are not physically connected to each other. The networks themselves can vary in their technical implementation (e.g., land-based internet services, phone lines, satellite, cell phone tower networks, etc.). However, in general, all of these communication networks were designed to find and connect devices together across vast geographic distances. </p>
			<p>Unfortunately, more often than not, any security that does exist for the communications traveling across these network systems were not a part of the original network designs, and if security is added it is often applied in a manner that has weaknesses (if security measures are even applied at all). </p>

			<h3>Types of Communications</h3>
			<p>To make things more complicated, there are different types of communications that travel across these networks. And the type of communication used often impacts the security. For example, the standards and set of rules (protocol) used to send an email differ from the protocol used to send a web page. While the format and way that you read these different types of communications are different, they are the similar in that the majority of the communication protocols were also not designed to protect the privacy of the data.</p>

				<td>Short Message Service</td><td>Text messages</td>

			<h3>Easily monitored</h3>

[insert infograph of open information travelling across the “wires”]
			<p>Since you cannot control the wires, switches, towers and other mechanisms used to connect one device to another, the communications that run across these networks can be viewed by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the companies that run the networks</li>
				<li>governments or other authorities that request access to the data that runs across the networks</li>
				<li>anyone that is also sitting on your network (e.g., shared internet café wifi or company internet)</li>
				<li>or by someone that hacked into an existing network.</li>

		<h3>The Definition of Snooping</h3>
		<p>The open design of the various communication networks combined with the open design of the communications themselves, allows for what is referred to as snooping. There are several open source software applications (available for no charge), and other tools that enable individuals to gather the data “packets” that are travelling across a network and read the data or listen in.</p>

		<p>This includes devices and software such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IMSI-catchers that are designed to trick a cell phone into connecting to the surveillance device instead of cell tower (e.g., StingRay)</li>
			<li>packet analyzers that capture and allow review of packets (e.g., Wireshark, NetworkMiner)</li>
			<li>Scanners that can be used to detect and identify devices</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Encryption is the answer</h3>
		<img src="images/encryption_markus-spiske.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
		<p>Since the common communication networks cannot be considered safe, and simply avoiding electronic communications is no longer an option in our digitally connected world, you might be asking yourself, can I even be secure?</p>

		<p>To be safe, you will need to identify and use protection. For network snooping, the overarching strategy used to protect the contents of your communications is encryption. The type of encryption applied can vary based on communication type and the network used. In the Protection Strategies lesson of this course, we will look at various tools that are available to protect your data and communications. We will also highlight those tools you should avoid. </p>

		<h3>Topic Review</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Most networks and the standard communications that travel across them are designed to be open</li>
			<li>This means Network Snooping is relatively easy for those with access to minor technical expertise</li>
			<li>Email, SMS, and Web traffic are just some examples of “open” communications</li>
			<li>Encryption is the best solution for overcoming the openness of networks’ designs</li>
